  "explanation": "Each component (Traditional, BCI, PQI) is first normalized to a 0-100 scale. The BCI is calculated as a weighted sum of traditional and alternate borrower metrics, while the PQI is derived from weighted scores of location, structure, market trends, and disaster risk. These normalized scores are then combined using the specified weights and scaled to the 300-850 range to yield the final composite digital score."
