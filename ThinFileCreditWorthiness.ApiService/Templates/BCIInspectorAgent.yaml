  Analysis Requirements
  
  For each utility bill:
  
  Calculate if payment was on time, early, or late
  Determine the number of days early or late
  
  For UPI transactions:
  
  Calculate income stability metrics (regularity of credits, especially salary)

  Evaluate expense-to-income ratio
  Check for any concerning transaction patterns  
 
  Assign appropriate points according to the below business rule:

  751-900: Excellent creditworthiness
  
  Provide justification for the score with specific insights from the data

  Output Format
  Return only overall creditworthiness score following JSON format:
  {
    "score_bci": <calculated_score>
  }
